**The game of Wither** - This is a browser-based card game. It has 16 levels, for each level you complete, new things and classes will become available to you, and your enemies will also become stronger. Gather the right equipment and defeat your opponents! And after completing all 16 levels, your prestige level will increase.

There are 9 enemies on each level. You need to defeat them all to move to the next level. By killing an enemy, you raise the level of your character specifically in this mission. If you try to kill an enemy whose level is higher than yours, you will certainly die.

This open source project was created for my portfolio. By the way, after some time after I created it, I stopped development for a long time. During this time I learned a lot, but the old code remained. So, if you look under the hood, you will find a lot of legacy code there. Sorry about that..

⚠️WARNING! The game is still undergoing tests, you may encounter bugs. My apologies.
